What is Encapsulation? why it is called data hiding ?

● Binding of data and corresponding methods into a single unit is called
"Encapsulation".

● If any java class follows data hiding and abstraction then such class is
referred as "Encapsulated class".

Encapsulation = Data Hiding + Data Abstraction.


ans 2 

We can achieve security.

● Enhancement becomes easy.

● Maintainability and modularisation becomes easy.

● It provides flexibility to the user to use the system very easily.

Setters

Setter methods are used to set the value to the instance variables of the class.

Syntax for setter method
a. compulsory the method name should start with set.
b. it should be public.
c. return type should be void.
d. compulsorily it should have some argument.

Getters

Getter methods are used to get the value from the instance variables of the class.

Syntax for getter method
a. compulsory the method name should start with get.
b. it should be public.
c. return type should not be void.
d. compulsorily it should not have any argument.

example -
class gen{
    private int id;
    private String name;
    public int getId() {
        return id;
    }
    public void setId(int id) {
        this.id = id;
    }
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    
}

Shadowing Problem and this keyword

● If both local variable and instance variable have the same name inside the
method then it would result in a name-clash and jvm will always give
preference for local variable. This approach is called the
“Shadowing problem”.
